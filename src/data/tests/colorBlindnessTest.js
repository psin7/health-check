  description: 'A simplified version of the Ishihara test to screen for red-green color vision deficiencies.',
  instructions: 'This test includes 10 Ishihara plates to assess your color vision. For each image, try to identify the number shown in the colored dots. Take your time and view each image in good lighting. If you wear glasses or contact lenses, keep them on during the test. If you cannot see a number or see a different number, select the appropriate option. This test is designed to detect common forms of color vision deficiency, particularly red-green color blindness.',
